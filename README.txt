----- WELCOME TO PYTHON: MASTERMIND -----

This is a project I (Wessel) made to gain experience with Python and
coding in general. 

Background on the original game:

It is based on the boardgame MASTERMIND, a 2-player game in which
one person creates a four colour code and another attempts to guess it.
My version includes 8 unique colours and 10 rows which the code-
breaker may use to guess the code.

--- HOW TO PLAY ---

You create a guess code by clicking on the selector pins on the right
hand of the screen and then clicking the holes in which you want to
place them. (You can only place in the closest, non scored, row to you.)

A Red pin is awarded for a correct colour which is also on the
corresponding place of that colour in the Code and a white pin for each
colour which appears in the code, but is not on the corresponding
place in the code.

Left click:
    - Select a colour pin
    - Place a pin

Right click:
    - Delete a placed pin
